		<h1>Doctrine of The Green Empower Organization</h1>

		<p>This is the doctrine of The Green Empower Organization.</p>

		<p>Life is a balancing act among many forces.</p>

		<p>(I will add more later lol)</p>

		<p>We need to do things like define negative and positive aspects of human nature and inclination. We also need to put these things in the greater context of science and nature. In fact we will need to base much of our social doctrine on the study of the human lineage and evolutionary biology. We will need to balance that with our leftist ideals.</p>

		<p>Our doctrine will be determined by our analysis of the past and our wishes for the future.</p>
